        "mainText": "On October 16, 1968, at the Olympic Games in Mexico City, two African American athletes made history not just for their athletic achievement, but for a silent protest that became an iconic symbol of the civil rights movement. Tommie Smith, who had just won the gold medal in the 200-meter sprint with a world record time, and John Carlos, who won bronze, raised their black-gloved fists during the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the medal ceremony.\n\nThe protest took place in Mexico, specifically at the Olympic Stadium in Mexico City. Smith and Carlos deliberately used the Olympic platform to protest racial discrimination in the United States. They were joined in solidarity by silver medalist Peter Norman from Australia, who wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge to show his support.\n\nThe gesture came at a time of intense social upheaval in the United States, and its impact was immediate and lasting. Both Smith and Carlos were expelled from the Olympic Village and faced intense criticism upon their return to the United States. However, their protest has endured as a defining moment in both Olympic and civil rights history."

        "mainText": "The Olympic Games have undergone a remarkable transformation in gender representation since their modern inception in 1896. At the first modern Olympics in Athens, women were completely excluded from competition, reflecting the social norms of the time. From these restrictive beginnings, where 0 female athletes competed alongside 125 male athletes, to the near gender parity achieved in recent Olympics, the journey spans over a century of progress and change.\n\nThe inclusion of women in the Olympics has been gradual but consistent. The 1900 Paris Olympics marked a pivotal moment as the first Games to include female athletes, though they numbered only 14 compared to 792 men. Women were initially limited to 'ladylike' sports such as tennis and golf. The International Olympic Committee, under the leadership of Pierre de Coubertin, was initially resistant to women's participation in many Olympic events.\n\nSignificant milestones in gender equality came in the late 20th century. The 1984 Los Angeles Olympics saw a dramatic increase in women's participation, with 1,200 female athletes competing. By the 2000 Sydney Olympics, women's participation had grown to over 3,000 athletes, representing nearly 40% of all competitors. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics marked a historic achievement with women making up close to 49% of all athletes.\n\nThis evolution reflects broader societal changes and persistent advocacy for gender equality in sports. The International Olympic Committee has played an increasingly active role in promoting women's participation, implementing quotas and adding new women's events to achieve greater gender balance."
