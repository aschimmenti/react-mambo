          These word clouds visualize the stark differences in how male and female athletes are portrayed in media coverage. The analysis spans Olympic coverage from multiple sources, including traditional media, commentary, and social platforms. This persistent language bias can affect public perception and perpetuate gender stereotypes in sports, highlighting the need for more balanced and achievement-focused coverage regardless of gender.
